# Multi-Agent System - Pharmaceutical Environment

Implementation of multi-agent systems in a pharmaceutical environment that enables communication between different agents by exchanging messages.

Various agents (users and suppliers) were created using the <b>Java Agent Development Framework (JADE)</b>, which interacts with the pharmacy agent. The purpose of this system is to ensure a balance between the amount of medication consumed by the user and sent from the pharmacy to the user and from the supplier to the pharmacy.
