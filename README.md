# Multi-Agent System: Pharmaceutical Environment

This repository contains an implementation of a multi-agent system in a pharmaceutical environment. The system enables communication between different agents by exchanging messages, and it is built using the Java Agent Development Framework (JADE).

## Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to create a system that facilitates communication and coordination among various agents, including users and suppliers, within the pharmaceutical domain. The system ensures a balance between medication consumption by users, medication supply from the pharmacy to the users, and medication supply from the suppliers to the pharmacy.

The system incorporates the following features:

- Creation of multiple users with their specific medication requirements
- Creation of several pharmacies to serve the users
- Inclusion of suppliers responsible for providing medication to the pharmacies
- Guaranteed warehousing to manage medication stocks
- Ability for agents to communicate with each other
- Implementation of a competition system between different suppliers

## System Requirements
The system is designed to fulfill the following requirements:

- Creation of multiple users: The system allows the creation of multiple user agents, each with their specific medication requirements.
- Creation of several pharmacies: Multiple pharmacy agents can be created to serve the users' medication needs.
- Creation of suppliers: Suppliers are responsible for providing medication to the pharmacies. The system allows the creation of various supplier agents.
- Guaranteed warehousing: The system ensures proper warehousing to manage medication stocks effectively. It tracks the availability of medication and ensures a balance between demand and supply.
- Ability to communicate between agents: Agents in the system can communicate with each other through message exchanges. This facilitates coordination and collaboration among users, pharmacies, and suppliers.
- Competition system between different suppliers: The system incorporates a competition system among the suppliers, which helps optimize the medication supply process.
