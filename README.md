# Multi-Agent System :: Pharmaceutical Environment

Implementation of multi-agent systems in a pharmaceutical environment that enables communication between different agents by exchanging messages.

Various agents (users and suppliers) were created using the <b>Java Agent Development Framework (JADE)</b>, which interacts with the pharmacy agent. The purpose of this system is to ensure a balance between the amount of medication consumed by the user and sent from the pharmacy to the user and from the supplier to the pharmacy.

## System Requirements

	• Creation of multiple users
	• Creation of several pharmacies
	• Creation of suppliers
	• Guaranteed warehousing
	• Ability to communicate between agents
	• Competition system between different suppliers

	In general, the system can manage the drug stocks of users, pharmacies and suppliers. Users must consume their medication according to their prescriptions and order medication from the pharmacy if necessary (small quantities in stock). In return, the pharmacy must ensure that it has stocks that meet users' needs and, if necessary, request suppliers.
